# Guqin Audio Project

## Description

This project focuses on audio processing, music generation related to the Guqin instrument. It utilizes deep learning models for feature extraction, sound synthesis, transcription. The Guqin is a traditional Chinese seven-stringed zither with a history of over 3,000 years, known for its subtle tones and rich playing techniques.

## Features

*   Guqin sound event detection and classification
*   Music generation for Guqin compositions
*   Audio effects processing tailored for Guqin sounds
*   Guqin playing technique recognition
*   Automatic transcription of Guqin recordings to notation
*   Style transfer between different Guqin schools and performers

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/guqin-audio-project.git
    cd guqin_audio
    ```

2.  **Create a Conda environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda create -n guqin_env python=3.10
    conda activate guqin_env
    ```

3.  **Install PyTorch and Torchaudio:**
    Visit [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) to find the correct installation command for your system and CUDA version. For example:
    ```bash
    # Replace cuXXX with your CUDA version (e.g., cu118, cu121) or use 'cpu' if you don't have a GPU
    pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cuXXX
    ```

4.  **Install other dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training a model
```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Processing audio files
```bash
python src/process.py --input path/to/audio --output path/to/output
```

### Generating Guqin music
```bash
python src/generate.py --model models/pretrained/guqin_generator.pt --output output/generated
```

### Running the demo interface
```bash
python src/app.py
```
